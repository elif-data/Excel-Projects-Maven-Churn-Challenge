# Excel-Projects-Maven-Churn-Challenge

This dataset contains 2 tables, in CSV format:

-The Customer Churn table contains information on all 7,043 customers from a Telecommunications company in California in Q2 2022
Each record represents one customer, and contains details about their demographics, location, tenure, subscription services, status for the quarter (joined, stayed, or churned), and more!

-The Zip Code Population table contains complimentary information on the estimated populations for the California zip codes in the Customer Churn table

Assuming the role of a BI Consultant for Maven Communications, the aim is to help the telecommunications company improve retention by identifying high value customers and churn risks, and to present your findings in the form of a single page report or dashboard.
